After my short stay at IPSoft, I wanted to do something more meaningful with long term impact. Hence, I joined Scania and started exploring the ideas behind autonomous driving. Since, I had no formal background in robotics I took the Udacity Nanodegree in Autonomous driving which gave a broad overview of perception, planning and control algorithms used in autonomous driving.
