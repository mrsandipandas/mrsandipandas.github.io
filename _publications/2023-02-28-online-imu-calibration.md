excerpt: "When deploying autonomous systems that require several sensors for perception, accurate and reliable extrinsic calibration is required. In this research, we offer a reliable technique that can extrinsically calibrate numerous lidars in the base frame of a moving vehicle without the use of odometry estimation or fiducial markers. Our method is based on comparing the raw IMU signals between a collocated IMU present with the lidar and the IMU measurements from the GNSS system in the vehicle base frame. Additionally, based on our observability criterion, we choose measurements that include the most mutual information rather than comparing all comparable IMU readings. This enables us to locate the measurements that are most useful for real-time calibration. Utilizing data gathered from Scania test vehicles with various sensor setups, we have successfully validated our methodology."
