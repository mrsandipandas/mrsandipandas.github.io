permalink: /publication/2023-02-28-online-imu-calibration
excerpt: "Modern autonomous systems typically use several sensors
for perception. For best performance, accurate and reliable
extrinsic calibration is necessary. In this research, we propose
a reliable technique for the extrinsic calibration of several
lidars on a vehicle without the need for odometry estimation or
fiducial markers. First, our method generates an initial guess of
the extrinsics by matching the raw signals of IMUs co-located
with each lidar. This initial guess is then used in ICP and point
cloud feature matching which refines and verifies this estimate.
Furthermore, we can use observability criteria to choose a
subset of the IMU measurements that have the highest mutual
information â€” rather than comparing all the readings. We have
successfully validated our methodology using data gathered
from Scania test vehicles."
