My main area of research is multi-modal SLAM for autonomous navigation. I have worked extensively with camera, lidar and radars and developed algorithms which have been deployed and tested in real vehicles in the automotive industry. My work has also touched upon cross-functional areas of online sensor calibration and intention prediction based on data driven techniques. My work in these areas have been published in prestigious journals and conferences that has received significant appreciation from the research community. Few highlights were -- IV Best Student Paper 2024 and ICRA Best Student Paper Award Finalist 2021, which came in colloaboration with Oxford Robotics Institute.
