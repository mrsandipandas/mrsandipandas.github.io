My main area of research is multi-modal SLAM for autonomous navigation. I have worked extensively with camera, lidar and radars and developed algorithms which have been deployed and tested in real vehicles in the automotive industry. My work has also touched cross-functional areas like auto-calibration and planning where I also used ML techniques. My work in these areas have been published in prestigious conferences and has received significant appreciation from the research community -- ICRA Best Student Paper Award Finalist 2021.
