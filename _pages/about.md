<p style="text-align: justify;"> 

I’m a Staff Engineer at Qualcomm, leading the development of next-generation ADAS solutions that power intelligent mobility for Tier-I OEMs globally. With a unique blend of hands-on technical depth and strategic vision, I drive cross-functional initiatives that bridge cutting-edge research with scalable, production-ready systems.

My journey began in full-stack engineering, where I built high-performance web and mobile applications. This foundation of software engineering evolved through a Master’s and PhD in SLAM and AI/ML, equipping me with deep expertise in spatial computing and autonomous perception.

Over the years, I’ve led the design and architecture of autonomous driving systems for global Tier-I OEMs &mdash; translating complex algorithms into robust, real-world solutions. At Qualcomm, I focus on shaping the ADAS technology roadmap, mentoring engineering teams, and collaborating with product and business stakeholders to deliver impactful solutions at scale.

I’m passionate about building high-performing teams, fostering innovation, and driving the future of autonomous systems through thoughtful leadership and technical excellence. I have extensive expertise in autonomous driving domain, backed by 10+ years of experience, where I have worked on &mdash; bringing up sensor platforms using sensor calibration and sensor fusion, as well as developed and architected algorithms for perception, localization and planning which were deployed in real vehicles. I have extensive experience in working with IMU, camera, lidar, radar and GNSS sensors.

I am deeply passionate about applying AI and computer vision to tackle complex problems in robotics and spatial computing. I earned a PhD in robotics from KTH, Sweden, supported by <a href="https://strategiska.se/en/">Swedish Foundation For Strategic Research</a> scholarship and <a href="https://www.scania.com/">Scania</a>.
