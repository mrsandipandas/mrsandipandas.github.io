<p style="text-align: justify;"> 

I earned a PhD in robotics from KTH, Sweden, supported by <a href="https://strategiska.se/en/">Swedish Foundation For Strategic Research</a> scholarship and <a href="https://www.scania.com/">Scania</a>. I have extensive expertise in autonomous driving, backed by 9+ years of experience, where I have worked from bringing up sensor platforms using sensor calibration as well as sensor fusion, and developed and architected algorithms for perception, localization and planning which was deployed in real vehicles. My research covers perception using cameras, lidar, and radar, alongside online sensor calibration and intention prediction through data-driven approaches. Currently, I concentrate on 3D reconstruction, integrating SLAM methods with deep learning to enhance spatial understanding and scene modeling. I am deeply passionate about applying AI and computer vision to tackle complex problems in robotics and spatial computing.
