<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I am a Staff Engineer at Qualcomm, leading the development of next-generation ADAS solutions that enable intelligent mobility for Tier-I OEMs worldwide. Combining hands-on technical expertise with strategic vision, I drive cross-functional initiatives that integrate cutting-edge research into scalable, production-ready systems.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Throughout my career, I have led the design and architecture of autonomous driving systems for global Tier-I OEMs, transforming complex algorithms into reliable real-world solutions. At Qualcomm, I focus on defining the ADAS technology roadmap, mentoring engineering teams, and working closely with product and business stakeholders to deliver impactful solutions at scale.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
I am committed to building high-performing teams, fostering innovation, and advancing autonomous systems through thoughtful leadership and technical excellence. With over 10 years of experience in the autonomous driving domain, I have extensive expertise in sensor platform integration — including sensor calibration and sensor fusion — and have developed and architected algorithms for perception, localization, and planning deployed in real vehicles. I have worked extensively with IMU, camera, LiDAR, radar, and GNSS sensors.
